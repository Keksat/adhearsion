0.8.7

0.8.6
 - Fix packaging problem so all files are publicly readable
 - Improve AMI reconnecting logic; add "connection refused" retry timer
 - AGI protocol improvements: parse the status code and response text

0.8.5
 - Added XMPP module and sample component. This allows you to easily write components which utilise a persistent XMPP connection maintained by Adhearsion
 - Prefer finding the dialplan.rb entry point by the AGI request URI instead of the calling context
 - Added :use_static_conf option for "meetme" to allow the use of disk-file-managed conferences
 - Logging object now shared with ActiveRecord and Blather
 - Fixed a longstanding bug where newlines were not sent after each AGI command
 - Fixed parsing of DBGet AMI command/response
 - Better shutdown handling/cleanup
 - Attempt to allow the AMI socket to reconnect if connection is lost
 - Improved support for Ruby 1.9
 - Numerous smaller bugs fixed. See: https://adhearsion.lighthouseapp.com/projects/5871-adhearsion/milestones/76510-085

0.8.4
 - Add configurable argument delimiter for talking to Asterisk.  This enables Adhearsion to support Asterisk versions 1.4 (and prior) as well as 1.6 (and later).
 - Fixed using ActiveRecord in Adhearsion components
 - Daemonizing no longer truncates the Adhearsion log file
 - Add support for using ActiveLdap
 - Misc improvements to support Asterisk 1.6 changes
 - Escape commands sent to Asterisk via AGI
 - Manager Events now work when daemonized

0.8.3
 - The "uniqueid" call channel variable available in dialplan.rb is now *always* a String
 - Renamed interruptable_play to interruptible_play and made interruptible_play() public instead of protected.
 - Fixed an Asterisk Manager Interface parsing issue in which colons sometimes got stuck into the key name.
 - AGI "request" variable coercer will not blow up if no request is given. (Helps in testing with netcat/telnet)

0.8.2
 - When a call hangs up, Adhearsion will no longer show random exceptions (that were okay) and instead allows the user to rescue a Hangup exception.
 - ManagerInterfaceResponse now include()s DRbUndumped, allowing send_action() to be called directly over DRb.
 - Fixes an inconsequential bug when CTL-C'ing Adhearsion.

0.8.1
 - The sandbox component now comes
 - Minor bug fixes

0.8.0 rev 2
 - Added a few non-critical files to the .gemspec. They were ignored

Notes from before 0.8.0:
 - (NOTE: This is obviously not a comprehensive list of pre-0.8.0 work. 0.8.0 was a complete rewrite of the previous version)
 - Adding a deprecation warning about Fixnum#digit and Fixnum#digits
 - Removed the AMI class and replaced it with the ManagerInterface class.
 - The old AMI high-level instance methods are available in the new ManagerInterface class, but a deprecation warning will be logged each time they're used. When the SuperManager class is implemented, they'll be removed entirely.
 - Moved Theatre into Adhearsion's lib folder.
